# example-project

## Introduction

This project is an example project to demonstrate how to document the information for your project in this README. Every repository in the UoA-CARES-Student group should have README to provide the minimum knowledge of your project to collaborators. This README is just an example, and your one may have different styles of this. Please keep in mind that README is for collaborators who haven't had any background on your project. That is, you shouldn't assume that they have a similar system environment to yours.

## Prerequisites

Please specify all the dependencies for your project. For example,

- OS ubuntu 16.04
- Python x.x
- OpenCV x.x
- Realsense camera D435 \* 2

## Installation guide

Please provide a very detailed installation guide here. Your project may require multiple steps to install a couple of libraries. Please spend enough time on this section for easy and accurate description. If you use a package-management system, it could be simple. For example, if pip is used, this command will install proper python libraries in your system.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

Please add descriptions or commands to run your project. If you need multiple steps to run your program, please specify all.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Directory hierarchy & Code structure

Please provide a directory hierarchy for your project. If you use Ubuntu, you can use this command to get it(tree hello-students). Also, you can use this command(git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | tree --fromfile) to get the structure under git control.
